RasterizerSSE - Scalable, thread-friendly, SIMD-optimized (SSE), tile-based software rasterizer module
TestRasterizer - Unit test for RasterizerSSE module using 4 threads to render 256 cubes with depth and linear depth output to a 256x128 depthbuffer and framebuffer. Left is rendered with D3D, right is software.

These modules are part of my ARF framework. Obviously, they won't compile without the other dependent libraries but I've included the binaries as a test.
